# PhD project

In this project, I analyse fecal microbiota from different rodents. Data from naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber, NMR; n=19) and Specific-Pathogen-Free mice (Mus musculus, SPF mouse, n=4) were newly obtained at Kumamoto University. Data from MSM/Ms and FVB/N mice were obtained at Chiba Cancer Center. Reads from Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis, DMR; n=20) [Bensch et al. 2022 PeerJ], European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, hare; n=9) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus, rabbit; n=12) [Shanmuganandam et al. 2020 PeerJ], Lesser blind mole-rat (Nannospalax leucodon, spalax; n=15) [Sibai et al. 2020 OMICS J Integr Biol], and Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans orii, PVO; n=19) [Liu et al. 2020 Sci Rep] were downloaded from previous studies.
